### Getting Started

> Assuming you are familiar with Firebase setup.


#### 1) Add `Google Services` files (plist & JSON)

- 1.1) **[Android]** Follow the `manually add firebase` to your app instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) to generate your `google-services.json` file if you haven't done so already - use the package name generated previously as your `Android package name`.
- 1.2) **[Android]** Place this file in the `android/app/` directory of your project.

#### 5) AdMob Setup (Or Removal)

- 5.1) React Native Firebase Starter kit comes with AdMob pre-install. The default Sample AdMob App ID is used in both the `info.plist` **[iOS]** and the `AndroidManifest.xml` **[Android]** files. If you don't want to use AdMob, just remove it. If you do, be sure to update your ID!
- 5.2) **[iOS]** Remove or change in `info.plist` by editing the `GADApplicationIdentifier` key string.
- 5.3) **[Android]** Remove or change in `AndroidManifest.xml` by modifying the content of `<meta-data />` tag within the `<application />` tag.
- 5.4) More instrucation can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start).

#### 6) Start your app

- 6.1) Start the react native packager, run `yarn run start` or `npm start` from the root of your project.
- 6.2) **[iOS]** Build and run the iOS app, run `npm run ios` or `yarn run ios` from the root of your project. The first build will take some time. This will automatically start up a simulator also for you on a successful build if one wasn't already started.
- 6.3) **[Android]** If you haven't already got an android device attached/emulator running then you'll need to get one running (make sure the emulator is with Google Play / APIs). When ready run `npm run android` or `yarn run android` from the root of your project.

If all has gone well you'll see an initial screen like the one below.
